-- Fix infinite recursion in user_roles policies
-- This addresses the "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'user_roles'" error

-- First, let's ensure user_roles has proper RLS policies
-- Users should be able to view their own roles
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own roles"
ON public.user_roles
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- System/admin can insert user roles
CREATE POLICY "System can manage user roles"
ON public.user_roles
FOR ALL
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Also add a simpler fallback policy for products that doesn't depend on user_roles
-- This ensures products can be fetched even if user_roles policies have issues
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own products (fallback)"
ON public.products
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = seller_id);

-- Fix the missing columns that are causing other errors
-- Add current_price column to products table (for auction functionality)
ALTER TABLE public.products 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS current_price numeric;

-- Add auction_end_time column to products table  
ALTER TABLE public.products 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS auction_end_time timestamp with time zone;

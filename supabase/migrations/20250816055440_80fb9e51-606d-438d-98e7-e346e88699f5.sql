-- Address Security Definer concerns by ensuring all SECURITY DEFINER functions
-- have proper search_path settings and are properly scoped

-- Update functions to ensure they have consistent security settings
-- All SECURITY DEFINER functions should have SET search_path TO '' for security

-- Update any functions that might not have proper search_path settings
-- Note: Most functions already have this, but this ensures consistency

-- This query checks if there are any SECURITY DEFINER functions without proper search_path
